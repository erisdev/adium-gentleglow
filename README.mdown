# Gentle Glow for Adium

* Version 1.5.1

* Created 10 October 2010

## Hacking

If you'd like to start hacking on GentleGlow (and who wouldn't), you're going to need a recent version of Ruby and a few gems.

### The bare necessities

These are the gems that are absolutely required to compile.

* coffee-script
* json
* rake
* sass
* tilt

### Test-driving your changes

You'll probably want to install Sinatra if you plan to do any extensive hacking, because your choices are basically either that or run `rake install` and restart Adium every time you change something.

Start the server with `rake mockup` and visit <http://localhost:4567> in your favorite browser, as long as it's Chrome or Safari.

### Building and installing

To build a tarball suitable for passing around to your friends, just run `rake package` and look in `dist/` for the result.

To install the message style automatically, use `rake install`.

A quick `rake -T` will show the other available tasks.

### Using Embed.ly

Support for Embed.ly is now included in the source, but—in the interest of
_not_ spreading around an API key—is disabled by default. To enable it, you
will need to get an Embed.ly API key and add it to `package.yaml` under
`api-keys`. It should look something like this:

    api-keys:
      tumblr: yourtumblrkeypleasedontusemineoriwillcomeandfindyou
      embedly: yourembedlykeybecauseimnotsureicandistributemine

You will also need to uncomment the `enableEmbedly` section in
`resources/data/preferences.yaml`.

## Credits & Acknowledgements

~~Gentle Glow began life as a heavily modified version of Ayumi Yonosa's
[1337][] message style with support for proportional fonts, but it quickly
evolved into a whole different animal. I'd be surprised if any vestige of the
original remains, but the inspiration is still there. Thank you, Ayumi!~~
There is nothing left of 1337 in here. So long and thanks for all the blurry
edges.

Color hashing uses the Unix ELF hash algorithm, adapted from Ruby 1.8's
implementation in `rb_str_hash`.

JavaScript magic is provided by [jQuery][], unfortunately.
