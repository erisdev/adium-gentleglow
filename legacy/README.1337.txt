  Inspiration
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The look of the "1337" message style is inspired by the h4x0r message
      style (hence the name) by phrenzy from previous work by Mark Fickett.
      
      See http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=1907 for the
      h4x0r style.

  Disclaimer
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This is my first attempt at style design. Things are probably a little
      rough... But anyway, comments/suggestions are welcome.

  Credits
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A special "thanks!" to Catfish (http://trac.adiumx.com/wiki/catfish_man) 
      who helped me to sort out bugs and find workarounds. Arigato gozaimasu!

  License
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Now, what about the license? Well, given that there is no real code
      involved (this is basically just a CSS anyway!), talking about license
      is probably overkill. So, let's just say that this style can be freely
      distributed, modified, tortured, etc. Credit would be nice, but I don't
      necessarily require it (but maybe that phrenzy and Catfish do! So check
      with them just in case...).
  
  So, here you are, hoping that someone, somewhere, at a given point in time,
  will find it useful, or at least, worth of downloading "just to have a look".
